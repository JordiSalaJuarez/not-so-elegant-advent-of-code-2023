# Advent of Code 2023
Probably a really bad idea but I'm going to test my python skills by solving all advent of code problems as python one liners. Obviously there's going to be a lot of duplicate & horrific code, viewer discretion is advised.

## Rules
Obviously there are several ways to make this challenge easier thus I'll be following this set of rules:
- it is not allowed to import any standard library
- shebangs, imports and comments don't count as part of the one liner
- semicolon is prohibited
- input is given by stdin
